### Style Detection Cheat Sheet

| If git log shows... | Use this style |
|---------------------|----------------|
| \`feat: xxx\`, \`fix: yyy\` | SEMANTIC |
| \`Add xxx\`, \`Fix yyy\`, \`xxx 추가\` | PLAIN |
| \`format\`, \`lint\`, \`typo\` | SHORT |
| Full sentences | SENTENCE |
| Mix of above | Use MAJORITY (not semantic by default) |

### Decision Tree

\`\`\`
Is this on main/master?
  YES -> NEW_COMMITS_ONLY, never rewrite
  NO -> Continue

Are all commits local (not pushed)?
  YES -> AGGRESSIVE_REWRITE allowed
  NO -> CAREFUL_REWRITE (warn on force push)

Does change complement existing commit?
  YES -> FIXUP to that commit
  NO -> NEW COMMIT

Is history messy?
  YES + all local -> Consider RESET_REBUILD
  NO -> Normal flow
\`\`\`

### Anti-Patterns (AUTOMATIC FAILURE)

1. **NEVER make one giant commit** - 3+ files MUST be 2+ commits
2. **NEVER default to semantic style** - detect from git log first
3. **NEVER separate test from implementation** - same commit always
4. **NEVER group by file type** - group by feature/module
5. **NEVER rewrite pushed history** without explicit permission
6. **NEVER leave working directory dirty** - complete all changes
7. **NEVER skip JUSTIFICATION** - explain why files are grouped
8. **NEVER use vague grouping reasons** - "related to X" is NOT valid

## FINAL CHECK BEFORE EXECUTION (BLOCKING)

\`\`\`
STOP AND VERIFY - Do not proceed until ALL boxes checked:

[] File count check: N files -> at least ceil(N/3) commits?
  - 3 files -> min 1 commit
  - 5 files -> min 2 commits
  - 10 files -> min 4 commits
  - 20 files -> min 7 commits

[] Justification check: For each commit with 3+ files, did I write WHY?

[] Directory split check: Different directories -> different commits?

[] Test pairing check: Each test with its implementation?

[] Dependency order check: Foundations before dependents?
\`\`\`

**HARD STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Making 1 commit from 3+ files -> **WRONG. SPLIT.**
- Making 2 commits from 10+ files -> **WRONG. SPLIT MORE.**
- Can't justify file grouping in one sentence -> **WRONG. SPLIT.**
- Different directories in same commit (without justification) -> **WRONG. SPLIT.**

---

### Commit Mode
- One commit for many files -> SPLIT
- Default to semantic style -> DETECT first

### Rebase Mode
- Rebase main/master -> NEVER
- \`--force\` instead of \`--force-with-lease\` -> DANGEROUS
- Rebase without stashing dirty files -> WILL FAIL

### History Search Mode
- \`-S\` when \`-G\` is appropriate -> Wrong results
- Blame without \`-C\` on moved code -> Wrong attribution
- Bisect without proper good/bad boundaries -> Wasted time`
