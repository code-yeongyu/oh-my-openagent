# Frontend

This file is a router, not a rulebook. The rules live in four rulesets under `references/`; your first job is to load the smallest set of files that covers the request, state which you loaded in one sentence, then execute under their guidance. Loading nothing and freestyling produces the generic AI-slop output this skill exists to prevent; loading everything wastes context and creates contradictory instructions.

**The bar is not clean-and-correct — it is work a senior designer at Linear, Stripe, or Supabase would ship.** Correct-but-flat is a failure, not a finish. Protect the surface as hard as you protect the build: design is a first-class deliverable, not a one-shot decision you lock and walk away from.

## Phase 0 — Route (before any UI work)

| Request involves… | Read |
|---|---|
| ANY UI implementation, styling, redesign, mockup, or visual decision | `references/design/README.md` FIRST. It enforces two mandatory gates — the Design System Gate (a `DESIGN.md` must exist before any component is written) and the React Dev Tooling Gate (react-grab / react-scan / react-doctor installed by default) — then routes to the taste and brand references below. |
| A new or substantially restructured multi-section marketing, editorial, portfolio, or discovery page without a user-supplied exact visual reference | ALSO `references/design/composition-skill.md`. Describe the approved content decision path, dominant composition, nav/footer voice, proof basis, and comparable-route rationale in the `DESIGN.md` Page Structure row. Keep the outcome aligned as concepts evolve. Component-only work, app shells, and exact-reference reproduction are exempt; an intentional template family may share one documented row. |
| Writing or modifying frontend code, OR auditing performance / SEO / accessibility / quality | ALSO `references/perfection/README.md`. Lighthouse 100 in every category, measured on real Playwright Chromium (never the `lighthouse` CLI), achieved through architecture — never by dropping animations or hiding content. |
| Looking up a concrete style, color palette, font pairing, chart type, landing-page structure, or UX guideline — or generating a project design system from keywords | `references/ui-ux-db/README.md`. A searchable CSV database with a CLI; a lookup tool, not a posture. Load on demand; `design` stays the source of truth for taste and the `DESIGN.md` contract. |
| ANY implementation or redesign that creates or updates `DESIGN.md` — plus explicit operating-layer asks (personas, critique, debt, handoff, synthetic user testing) | `references/designpowers/README.md` + `references/designpowers/lane-c-review.md`. An internal frontend ruleset, not a separate skill: lane-c is the Phase Final flatness/critique reviewer, and its accessibility-constraints and accepted-debt language fills the required `DESIGN.md` sections. Load other lanes only when their phase applies. |

**For implementation work, design + perfection load together.** A page that hits Lighthouse 100 but looks like AI slop has failed; a page that looks beautiful but ships a 2 MB bundle has failed. Both win or neither does.

## Design System and Component Workflow

Every implementation must choose one of these branches before UI code changes:

1. **Concrete visual reference:** the user supplied a reference — treat it as the visual contract, then handle it by kind:
   - **Static visual reference** (screenshot, generated mockup, Stitch/Imagen output, Figma export, overview, or annotated packet): load `references/design/image-to-code-skill.md` plus the relevant design/perfection files, extract the reference's exact tokens, layout geometry, copy, spacing, states, and responsive intent into `DESIGN.md`, then implement reusable primitives against that contract.
   - **Live site or URL reference** (the user names a site to clone or gives a URL): load `references/design/clone-from-url.md`. Drive a real browser and extract the runtime truth via `getComputedStyle` — tokens, layout geometry, default/hover/focus/active states, transitions and keyframes, and downloaded assets — into `DESIGN.md`, then clone-code reusable primitives against that contract.
   Final QA for both runs `/visual-qa` in reference-fidelity mode: compare the actual UI against the reference pixel-by-pixel and verify the code is an extensible design-system implementation, not a screenshot-matched one-off.
2. **Greenfield or fresh setup:** if the user gave no concrete visual reference, design research is a build step with named deliverables. Route by surface, run the applicable lanes in parallel before `DESIGN.md` is written, and open `DESIGN.md` with a `## 0. Research Log` section recording each deliverable. Skip a lane only when its tool or network is genuinely unavailable, and name the skip in `DESIGN.md`:
   - **Embedded references:** for marketing, editorial, portfolio, and discovery surfaces, use `references/design/_INDEX.md` to shortlist 2-3 plausible Layer B references, then read exactly one Layer A style skill and one Layer B reference in full. For dashboards and other operational product UI, use the `taste-skill.md` **Brief to Design System Map** only to choose an official design system, then follow that system and `layout-skill.md`. After built-in OMO curation, query a configured local Open Design service through its `od` CLI or MCP only when no suitable built-in fit exists or the user explicitly requests Open Design. If the integration is unavailable, state that boundary and use the closest curated fallback. Add `ui-ux-db` lookups for palette, type, or domain questions.
   - **Lazyweb real-product screens:** for applicable marketing, editorial, portfolio, and discovery work, read `references/design/lazyweb.md` first and follow its recipe. Log the queries, screens actually viewed, and layout grammar harvested without copying pixels.
   - **Content and composition outcome:** inventory approved content and proof inputs, understand each block's role in the visitor's decision path, and use `references/design/composition-skill.md` for applicable multi-section pages. The Section 4 row makes sequence, dominant spatial relationship, nav/footer voice, proof basis, and comparable-route reasoning visible without prescribing a fixed catalog. Keep it current when a concept legitimately changes the composition.
   - **Imagen concept drafts:** for an applicable expressive page, generate 2-3 drafts from the research outcomes and the selected Layer A and Layer B tokens. Pick the strongest and treat it as the reference-fidelity contract. Log the draft paths and the pick.
   Synthesize each applicable lane into `DESIGN.md`. Treat sources as source material, not mood labels: extract tokens, layout grammar, component anatomy, interaction states, motion, and taste decisions, then recombine them into project-specific primitives. Order approved content by the visitor's decision path, never invent proof to complete a layout, and never copy logos or brand-specific copy. Then run the Primitive Showcase Gate in `references/design/README.md` before any product screen.
3. **Existing project with `DESIGN.md` or a component system:** read it, follow it, and update it before implementation only when the requested work needs a new token, primitive, state, motion rule, accessibility constraint, accepted debt, reference-fidelity requirement, or applicable Page Structure outcome.
4. **Existing project with UI but no `DESIGN.md` and no reusable component layer:** STOP and ask the user one focused question: should you preserve the current look with copy-nearby styling, or extract a real `DESIGN.md` plus reusable components before continuing? Do not silently choose.

For implementation, redesign, or design-system work that creates or updates `DESIGN.md`, `references/designpowers/README.md` + `lane-c-review.md` are part of the default load — feed their personas, accessibility, critique, debt, handoff, and role-reference guidance into the branch above. The resulting `DESIGN.md` is the implementation contract: tokens, typography, spacing, primitives, motion, responsive behavior, accessibility constraints, and accepted debt must be named there before code uses them. Verify component primitives, states, and final screens with real visual QA evidence; pass design-system decisions, implementation evidence, and unresolved debt into `/review-work` for significant implementation work.

## Ruleset 1 — design (`references/design/`)

The visual reference library has one architecture file, 12 taste skills (Layer A: *how to execute*), and 70 brand design systems (Layer B: *what it should look like*), plus project-original structural mechanics. Most non-trivial marketing, editorial, portfolio, and discovery tasks load **one Layer A + one Layer B**. Operational product UI uses the `taste-skill.md` **Brief to Design System Map** only, then follows the selected official design system with `layout-skill.md`. `README.md` carries the routing and QA contract; `_INDEX.md` catalogs the choices.

### Layer 0 — architecture

| File | Read when |
|---|---|
| `design-system-architecture.md` | The project has no `DESIGN.md` (defines the structure you must create first — 8 sections plus a greenfield-only `## 0. Research Log`), or you are extracting a design system from existing UI code. |

### Project-original structural mechanics

| File | Read when |
|---|---|
| `composition-skill.md` | A new or substantially restructured multi-section marketing, editorial, portfolio, or discovery page has no user-supplied exact visual reference, or a comparable sibling risks becoming a color-only structural clone. It owns page shape and proof inputs, not visual taste. |
| `layout-skill.md` | An app shell, dashboard, settings surface, inbox, split pane, or other operational UI needs spatial mechanics and scroll ownership. |

### Layer A — taste skills (pick AT MOST ONE style skill; they encode opposing philosophies)

| File | Read when the user says… |
|---|---|
| `taste-skill.md` | Neutral or operational UI with no surface ambition — internal tools, dashboards, "just make it usable". The safe default; do NOT settle here when the brief signals glossy / premium / startup-grade craft. |
| `gpt-tasteskill.md` | "Awwwards-tier", "wow factor", "cinematic", "scroll-triggered" marketing/landing experiences. |
| `minimalist-skill.md` | "minimal", "clean", "Notion-like", "Linear-like", "editorial". |
| `brutalist-skill.md` | "brutalist", "raw", "Swiss", "experimental", "anti-design". |
| `soft-skill.md` | "premium", "luxury", "calm", "expensive", "elegant", AND glossy / glassy / liquid-glass / startup-grade product surfaces — pair with a high-craft Layer B (`supabase`, `linear.app`, `vercel`, `stripe`). |
| `redesign-skill.md` | Improving EXISTING UI — "this looks bad", "fix the design". Audit-first workflow; never use on greenfield. |
| `image-to-code-skill.md` | "Generate the design first, then code it." Pair with one imagegen file below. |
| `output-skill.md` | Stacks on any style skill when output is incomplete — placeholders, `// TODO`, half-done components. |
| `stitch-skill.md` | Stacks on any style skill for Google Stitch compatibility or a `DESIGN.md` doc export. A complete worked export ships as `stitch-design-example.md`. |
| `imagegen-frontend-web.md` / `imagegen-frontend-mobile.md` / `imagegen-brandkit.md` | Image-only output (mockup, app-screen concepts, brand board). These NEVER write code — switch to `image-to-code-skill.md` if code is wanted. |

### Layer B — brand design systems (orthogonal to Layer A; stack freely)

When the user names a brand or site, load `references/design/<brand>.md` as the token source of truth. Extract its palette, type scale, components, and interaction language, then apply them to the project's own content without copying logos or trademarked imagery. If the named brand is missing, start with a curated Layer A and Layer B mood match. Query a configured local Open Design service through its `od` CLI or MCP only when built-in OMO curation has no suitable fit or the user explicitly requests Open Design.

### React dev tooling

| File | Read when |
|---|---|
| `react-dev-tooling-skill.md` | A React project lacks react-grab / react-scan / react-doctor, or you need per-framework install snippets and the dev-only gating pattern (`NODE_ENV === 'development'`). |

## Ruleset 2 — perfection (`references/perfection/`)

| File | Read when |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Any frontend code is written or audited. Carries the seven tenets: real-browser audits only, 100-in-every-category floor, fix-at-the-architecture, never weaken UX for points, design-system compliance checks, and the response format for audit reports. |
| `react-perf-tooling.md` | Before ANY React audit. The Playwright + `playwright-lighthouse` + `react-scan/lite` injection recipe, per-route render budgets, and the React-specific root-cause checklist. Lighthouse 100 with 30+ unnecessary renders is NOT done. |

Audit CLI (build for production first; never measure a dev server):

```bash
uv run $SKILL_DIR/scripts/perfection/lighthouse-audit.py https://localhost:3000
```

Run mobile AND desktop presets, 3–5 runs, take the median, diagnose from the JSON report.

## Ruleset 3 — ui-ux-db (`references/ui-ux-db/`)

`README.md` documents the search CLI and the master-plus-overrides persistence pattern. The CLI (run from the ruleset directory so it finds `data/`):

```bash
python3 $SKILL_DIR/references/ui-ux-db/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system -p "Project"   # full design-system generation
python3 $SKILL_DIR/references/ui-ux-db/scripts/search.py "<query>" --domain <domain>             # targeted lookup
python3 $SKILL_DIR/references/ui-ux-db/scripts/search.py "<query>" --stack <stack>               # stack best practices
```

Domains: `product` `style` `typography` `color` `landing` `chart` `ux` `react` `web` `prompt`. Stacks: `html-tailwind` (default) `react` `nextjs` `vue` `svelte` `astro` `swiftui` `react-native` `flutter` `shadcn` `jetpack-compose`.

## Ruleset 4 — designpowers (`references/designpowers/`)

`README.md` routes design operating-layer guidance from the pinned `Owl-Listener/designpowers` reference corpus into the existing frontend workflow. Load it — together with `lane-c-review.md` — for every implementation or redesign that creates or updates `DESIGN.md`, and additionally when a task needs explicit personas, accessibility and cognitive constraints, design critique, design debt, handoff, synthetic user testing, motion guidance, or role-reference prompts. It does not replace this frontend skill, `/visual-qa`, `/ulw-plan`, `/start-work`, or `/review-work`; it supplies richer design context that must first be distilled into the project `DESIGN.md`, then used as the design-system contract for implementation and verification.

## Quick routes — most common requests

| Request | Load |
|---|---|
| "Build a landing page" (no direction given) | `design/README.md` + `design/composition-skill.md` + `design/_INDEX.md` shortlist, then exactly one Layer B reference + `design/taste-skill.md` + `perfection/README.md` |
| "Aside-style AI browser / browser agent page" | `design/README.md` + `design/aside.md` + `design/taste-skill.md` + `perfection/README.md` |
| "Linear-style landing page" | `design/README.md` + `design/linear.app.md` + `design/taste-skill.md` + `perfection/README.md` |
| "Premium SaaS hero like Stripe" | `design/README.md` + `design/stripe.md` + `design/soft-skill.md` + `perfection/README.md` |
| "Improve this existing dashboard" | `design/README.md` + `design/redesign-skill.md` + `perfection/README.md` |
| "Build this screenshot / Imagen mock / Stitch output exactly" | `design/README.md` + `design/image-to-code-skill.md` + `perfection/README.md` + `/visual-qa` reference-fidelity mode |
| "Audit my site" / "make this page faster" | `perfection/README.md` (+ `perfection/react-perf-tooling.md` if React) |
| "Mockup image of a fintech app" — no code | `design/imagegen-frontend-mobile.md` (+ a Layer B brand if named) |
| "What palette/fonts fit a wellness brand?" | `ui-ux-db/README.md` → search CLI |
| "What do shipped apps in this space look like?" / design-direction research | `design/lazyweb.md` (curl-only) + `design/_INDEX.md` shortlist |
| "Set up this React project" | `design/README.md` + `design/react-dev-tooling-skill.md` |
| "Use designpowers", "make the design workflow stronger", "add personas/accessibility/debt/handoff" | `design/README.md` + `designpowers/README.md` (+ `perfection/README.md` if implementation or audit follows) |

## Shared axioms (all four rulesets agree — apply always)

- **No design system = no UI work.** `DESIGN.md` exists before components do; every color, font size, and spacing value traces back to a token in it.
- **Concrete reference = contract.** When a screenshot, generated mockup, overview, or annotated reference exists, the implementation must match its pixels, copy, component structure, and responsive intent unless the user explicitly accepts a deviation.
- **Structure follows the brief.** For an eligible multi-section page, the current Page Structure outcome, DOM order, and responsive captures agree. Comparable routes do not become unexplained copy-and-color variants of one template.
- **Proof must be real.** Metrics, testimonials, logos, rankings, certifications, and case outcomes trace to user-supplied or cited inputs. Otherwise omit the proof-shaped slot or keep an explicitly labeled non-production placeholder that production removes.
- **Never weaken UX OR flatten the surface to buy points.** No dropping animations, hiding content, simplifying interactions, or replacing rendered/lit material with flat fills and flat geometric primitives for a Lighthouse score or a deadline. Hit 100 AND keep the surface dimensional — both, or neither.
- **No emojis as icons.** SVG icon sets only (Lucide, Heroicons, Radix, Phosphor).
- **GPU-composited animation only** — `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`; never animate layout properties.
- **Slop animation is forbidden — motion serves meaning.** Every animation or hover must map to a real interaction, state change, or affordance. A hover that changes nothing, motion on a non-interactive element, or a decorative micro-animation with no informational purpose is slop — do not add it.
- **Done is the `/visual-qa` dual-oracle gate, not your own glance.** A frontend design task is verified through `/visual-qa` (real browser at 375 / 768 / 1280px, every page, with interaction states and motion driven and inspected) until the dual-oracle completion gate passes on fresh evidence.

## When to load something else instead

| Situation | Load |
|---|---|
| Built-in OMO references have no suitable fit, or the user explicitly requests Open Design | Query a configured local Open Design service through its `od` CLI or MCP inside this frontend route. OMO does not bundle a separate Open Design workflow. If the integration is unavailable, state the boundary and use the closest curated fallback. |
| Driving a browser for the Design QA phase | `agent-browser` skill |
| Pure TypeScript/logic work with zero visual surface | `programming` skill alone — this skill adds nothing there |

## Activation

Use for any frontend, web UI, UX, visual, design, styling, layout, animation, performance, accessibility, or SEO work — building, redesigning, auditing, or generating mockups. Not for backend, CLI, or pure-logic tasks with no visual surface.
